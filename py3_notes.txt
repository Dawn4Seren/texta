###################### TERMINOLOGY MANAGEMENT #################################
    # SEARCHER +
        === current search === +
        + search
        + regular highlighting, but not on the txt_5000 file as mentioned below, might be from whitespace
        + translit highlighting
        +- short search
        + expand search
        + save search
        +- bring up saved searches
        +- concept/lexicon suggestions

        === cluster search === +
        +- cluster search clustering method: hierarchical
        +- cluster search, kmeans, tfidf, countvectorizer, cluster sizes, stopwords lexicon
        += also make a slider for tfidf max features
        += also add the short version
        == also make it so that you can select the certain documents in the cluster and export them/search on them or something
        += also show the words seperately instead of only when hovering
        += also make a cluster wordset into a lexicon

        === results === +
        +- export
        +- delete results; probs some es problem; comes out also in master (not py3 related)
        += also the search result amount is only on the bottom (probably not py3 related)

        === Aggregations === +?
        +-? aggregation; somewhat works, unclear if it works or not since "errors" are also in other branches, also multi aggregation doesnt work (actually just cant aggregate to significant words)
        +- now you can't aggregate to texta_facts, added to reserved (not really py3 related)
        +- also now you cant see the add button when the field#1 aggregation is "significant words". (not really py3 related, javascript change)
        + hide current search in results


    #LEXICON MINER +
        +- all word suggestion types
            += actually works, just you cant use it with only one word
            += nevermind still doesn't work for some reason
            += was caused by python2 formats? or zip not throwing an exception
            +- actually randomly clusterings don't work anymore
            +- also term candidates shows raha[punct] now for some reason
            +- also suggest words doesn't work sometimes unless you press reset suggestions
        + save lexicon
            +- also doesn't work for some lexicons, like kohtu
                += was caused by trying to write binary to non binary file
                +=create new lexicon, click on it, find some suggestions, press save, doesn't save
                +=ctrl f5 page, randomly add words there, press save, now saves SOMETIMES (maybe when restarting server works)
        + reset suggestions
        += should display which lexicon is selected.
        += also autoselect newly created lexicon

    #CONCEPTUALISER +
        +- plotting
        + all methods
        + combine
        + dissolve
        + commit results
        == in terminlogy overview when you have no longer existing queries the old concepts still stay
    #MWE MINER +
        + start task works somehow, including different options
        + remove result
        + MWE Task result reverse value list (also got index out of range somewhere, can't replicate)
        + force all true
        + force all false
        += also test with multiple lexicons

    #GRAMMAR MINER ???

        + rutest.txt imported, mlp worked, note /home/eha/Documents/texta/texta-py3/texta/dataset_importer/document_storer/storers/elastic_storer.py line 117, looping over only non mlp values
        + removing a model

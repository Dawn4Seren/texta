+ = WORKS
- = DOESN'T
+- = DIDN'T BUT NOW DOES
? = UNCLEAR
=== === = category within a header
== = note or something to do
+= = now implomented succesfully/note tested

### WHAT WORKS/DOESNT:

# HOME +
+ Change Password

# ADMINISTRATION
+ Dataset Management

# IMPORTER
+ lorem_ipsum.txt imported
+ rutest.txt imported, mlp worked, note /home/eha/Documents/texta/texta-py3/texta/dataset_importer/document_storer/storers/elastic_storer.py line 117, looping over only non mlp values

# SEARCHER
=== current search === +
+ search
+ regular highlighting, but not on the txt_5000 file as mentioned below, might be from whitespace
+ translit highlighting
+- short search
+ expand search
+ save search
+- bring up saved searches
+- concept/lexicon suggestions

=== cluster search === +
+- cluster search clustering method: hierarchical
+- cluster search, kmeans, tfidf, countvectorizer, cluster sizes, stopwords lexicon
+= also make a slider for tfidf max features
+= also add the short version
== also make it so that you can select the certain documents in the cluster and export them/search on them or something
== also show the words seperately instead of when hovering
== also make a cluster wordset into a lexicon

=== results ===
+- export
- delete results   
== also the search result amount is only on the bottom (probably not py3 related)

=== Aggregations ===
+-? aggregation; somewhat works, unclear if it works or not since "errors" are also in other branches, also multi aggregation doesnt work (actually just cant aggregate to significant words)
+- now you can't aggregate to texta_facts, added to reserved (not really py3 related)
+- also now you cant see the add button when the field#1 aggregation is "significant words". (not really py3 related, javascript change)
+ hide current search in results


#MODEL MANAGER +
+- making a model
+ all options
+ removing a model

#LEXICON MINER +
+- all word suggestion types
    - actually randomly clusterings don't work anymore
    - also term candidates shows raha[punct] now for some reason
    - also suggest words doesn't work sometimes unless you press reset suggestions
+ save lexicon
    - also doesn't work for some lexicons, like kohtu
        =create new lexicon, click on it, find some suggestions, press save, doesn't save
        =ctrl f5 page, randomly add words there, press save, now saves SOMETIMES (maybe when restarting server works)
+ reset suggestions

#CONCEPTUALISER +
+- plotting
+ all methods
+ combine
+ dissolve
+ commit results

#MWE MINER +
+ start task works somehow, including different options
+ remove result
+ MWE Task result reverse value list (also got index out of range somewhere, can't replicate)
+ force all true
+ forse all false
== also test with multiple lexicons
